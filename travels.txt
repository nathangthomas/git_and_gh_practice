#Travels
##My favorite travel experience:
My very favorite travel experience was when my wife and I set out to live and work in NZ. The idea was to work for part of the year in NZ and use the money we made to travel around SE Asia with the ultimate goal of coming home after a year with more money than we left with. The trip was a success as we not only met that goal, but had an amazing time doing it. My favorite part of that tip was exploring the Indonesian Islands of Bali and Gili T.
